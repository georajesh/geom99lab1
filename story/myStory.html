      <h2>TIA to HIA</h2>
      <p>On August 29, 2023, I departed from Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu, Nepal at 18:00. It was a 5 hours flight to Hamad International Airport, Doha, Qatar. After arrival, I had to wait 7 hours for my next flight to Zurich. </p>
      <h2>HIA to ZUR</h2>
      <p>Finally after sleeping the night out at HIA for about 7 hours, I took my flight to Zurich at 2:00. All I could do was sleep again with not even having a single person to talk with. The world is strange, wish we could all talk like a one good family.</p>
      <h2>ZUR to YYZ</h2>
      <P>It was not the end. I had to wait for another 6 hours at Zurich Airport. I realised the airport was pretty good and people too. Atleast, I got someone to chat for sometime in overwhelming loneliness. I was enjoying every second of the trip but missing home at the same time. Finally, after 9  hours of flight, I arrived to my fate, Pearson International Airport, Toronto, Canada.</P>
