      <h2>TIA to HIA</h2>
      <p>On August 29, 2023, I embarked on my journey from Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, Nepal, at 18:00. The initial leg of my travel involved a 5-hour flight to Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar. Upon reaching Doha, I found myself with a 7-hour layover before my connecting flight to Zurich.</p>
      <h2>HIA to ZUR</h2>
      <p>After spending the night at Hamad International Airport, where I managed to catch about 7 hours of sleep, I boarded my flight to Zurich at 2:00. The journey was characterized by solitude, as there was no one to engage in conversation with. It made me reflect on the peculiar nature of the world; I couldn't help but wish for a global community where everyone could communicate and connect like one united family.</p>
      <h2>ZUR to YYZ</h2>
      <P>The journey didn't conclude there. Following my arrival at Zurich Airport, another 6-hour wait awaited me. Surprisingly, I found the airport to be quite pleasant, and the people there were friendly. It provided a welcome break from the overwhelming loneliness I had experienced earlier. Engaging in conversation with someone, even if only for a short while, brought a sense of enjoyment to every passing second of the trip. Nevertheless, amidst the adventure, a longing for home persisted. Ultimately, after a 9-hour flight, I reached my destinationâ€”Pearson International Airport in Toronto, Canada.</P>
